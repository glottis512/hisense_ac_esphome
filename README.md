# Hisense Air Conditioner Component for ESPHome

This project is a replacement hardware and a matching ESPHome external component for  Hisense Air Conditioners Wifi Module. While these Wifi modules allow control over the AC (even local only) with [integration to HA](https://github.com/deiger/AirCon), the module itself is highly unreliable.
By replacing the existing Hisense module with our custom one we achieve better reliabilty, faster response time and additional information about the AC unit.
